# Unusual Spends Alert System

## Problem Statement

- You work at a credit card company and as a value-add they want to start providing alerts to users when their spending in any particular category is higher than usual.
- Compare the total amount paid for the current month, grouped by category with the previous month.
- Filter down to the categories for which the user spent at least 50% more this month than last month.
- Compose an e-mail message to the user that lists the categories for which spending was unusually high.
